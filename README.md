# PyDrive
A Python script to upload files to my drive using PyDrive and Google Cloud Platform API's 
<br> Recently I discovered that I could upload whatever I want onto my Google Drive provided from my college.:grin: <br> <br>
**No File Size limitations,though there is a max size of 2TB per file restriction** :smirk:

<u>I got help from this medium article 
><a href="https://medium.com/@annissouames99/how-to-upload-files-automatically-to-drive-with-python-ee19bb13dda">Medium</a></u>

Though the article is missing out where you have to add a .json file from you GOOGLE Cloud platform into you directory

This is my first README.md  I KNOW IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL :)

# Turns out google cloud platform has some restriction to large files and I don't think PyDrive can upload video files(nobody said it couldn't).
